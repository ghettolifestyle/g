                        entrance song</a> that i discovered by chance on a walk today
                        while writing this</em></p>

                        <p>so, the blog got vaporized once again due to some
                        questionable yet funny design choices made by yours truly, and
                        it feels great, honestly. like shed weight. razing things to the
                        ground and starting anew seems to be my kind of thing.  still,
                        the old posts shall return once more in the near future.  just
                        sleep a little and check back soon.  it's good to get some
                        rest</p>

                        <p>these html files are being typed out by hand in vim using
                        <code>colo default</code> and <code>background=light</code>
                        on alacritty using xterm colors. these are truly the end
                        times. i currently lack the mental requisites to fix my
                        shit, i.e. my life and the ghetto site generator. looked
                        into writing my own templating "engine" and even
                        contemplated writing it in perl which should speak volumes
                        about the levels of desperation at play here. page is hosted
                        via cloudfront + s3 for now, both of which are great
                        products. thanks, cloud overlords</p>

                        <p>thoughts on wasteland 2 coming soon. rss feed generation
                        coming soon</p>

                        <p>god bless</p>
